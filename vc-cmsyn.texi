@chapter Getting Started
@cindex getting started installation install

@ibmrs{} is a (proprietary) versioning system, part of the
IBM Rational toolchain. It is a classic check-in/check-out style versioning
system, but uses this in conjunction with tasks set by administrative
and/or support personnel.

This integration is set up to work with version 7.2 of @ibmrs{}

@enumerate

@item
To be able to use this package, add the package's path to the load-path, or
install the module in a location which is pointed to by the load-path.

If the package needs to be added to the load-path, use the following syntax:

@example
(setq load-path (cons <package-directory> load-path))
@end example

@item 
Load the vc-rational-synergy integration module:
@example
(require 'vc-rational-synergy)
@end example

@item
Put the next line in the custom-set-variables section of your initialisation file (probably .emacs):
@example
 '(vc-cmsyn-auto-check-status-file-open-p t)
@end example

@item 
The CMSynergy menu is found in the menu-bar under Tools by default:

@node Functionality, Customization, Getting Started, Top
@chapter Functionality

Functionality of @ibmrs{} is divided into several features. Authentication provides the means to be able to authenticate against an @ibmrs{} server, such that it is possible to interact with the necessary tooling. Further, there is the ability to perform task management, a rather isolate feature of this particular version control system. Then there is the ability for modification of files and directories. The last feature is to be able to perform difference analysis.

A significant change between the original Telelogic Change Synergy command infrastructure is that the commands are now implemented using the format options of the Command-Line interface (@pxref{CLI}), and the transcript is not used anymore for data capture.

@node Authentication, Task Management, , Functionality
@chapter Authentication
@cindex authentication functionality

Through authentication, it is possible to be able to communicate with the @ibmrs{} server.

@menu
* Login...:: Logging in
* Logout...:: Logging out
* Current User:: Display information for the current user
* Status:: Display generic status information
@end menu

@node Login..., Logout..., , Authentication
@chapter Login...
@cindex authentication functionality

(Menu > @ibmrs{} > Login...)@*
(M-x vc-rational-synergy-login RET)

An @ibmrs{} session will be started. During the startup, an authentication
process will be processed, where information is gathered from the minibuffer.

Normally, the values will be gathered from the surrounding settings
when possible, especially, the user name will be gathered from the system
environment. It is possible to preset these values either by using their
appropriate environment values, otherwise by setting them through customization
values.

The login procedure will be automatically launched if an @ibmrs{} request
is made, unless the customization value
@code{vc-rational-synergy-authentication-explicit} is set.

The login process uses the minibuffer for requesting authentication details.
Of logging on is successful, this will be shown to the user explicitly,
if it failed, it will also be shown.

After a valid login, the system enviroment variable @code{CCM_ADDR} is used
for storing the information. Internally, @ibmrs{} uses this value to
recognize the appropriate session. By checking the status (@pxref{Status}),
it is possible to see if an authentication process has been proceeded
properly.

The environment variable which can be set are:

@anchor{CCM_USERNAME}
@anchor{CCM_DATABASE}
@anchor{CCM_HOST}

@table @code
@item CCM_USERNAME
Overrides the user name, otherwise `user-login-name' is used. @ref{Username}.
@item CCM_DATABASE
Sets the database location. @ref{Database}.
@item CCM_HOST
Sets the host location. @ref{Host}.
@end table

@section Username
@anchor{Username}

During the process of authentication, the user name will be requested in
the Emacs minibuffer (Echo area). If available, it
will suggest the default setting, which is derived from the
@code {vc-rational-synergy-authentication-username} customization setting. If
the customization setting is empty, it will attempt to use the user name
setting from the @ref{CCM_USERNAME} environment variable. If that is unavailable
it will use the currently logged in user name.

By entering another valid user name, this name will be used while authenticating.

@section Password
@anchor{Password}

During the process of authentication, the password will be requested in
the Emacs minibuffer (Echo area). Although all the other authentication 
settings can be configured, due to security reasons, the password must be
supplied directly by the user.

@section Database
@anchor{Database}

During the process of authentication, the database will be requested in
the Emacs minibuffer (Echo area). If available, it will
suggest the default setting, which is derived from the
@code{vc-rational-synergy-authentication-settings} customization setting. If
the customization setting is empty, it will attempt to use the database setting
from the @ref{CCM_DATABASE} environment variable. If that is not present either,
it is mandatory to enter a valid database name.

By entering another valid database name, this name will be used while authenticating
as location of the database.

@section Host
@anchor{Host}

During the process of authentication, the host name will be requested in
the Emacs minibuffer (Echo area). If available, it will
suggest the default setting, which is derived from the
@code{vc-rational-synergy-authentication-settings} customization setting. If
the customization setting is empty, it wil attempt to use the host setting
from the @ref{CCM_HOST} environment variable. Further, if these are not set,
it will attempt to derive a valid setting from the @ref{Database}.

By entering another valid host name, this name will be used while authenticating
as location of the @ibmrs{} server.

@node Task Management, Authentication, Buffer operations, Functionality
@chapter Task Management
@cindex task functionality

Task management is performed by the user to be able to switch between several
assigned tasks within the context of a particular work area. Typically,
to be able to work on a particular file, it is necessary to set a task
as default task, on which further actions are performed.

@menu
* Show Default Task:: Shows the default task being currently selected
* Show Task Files:: Shows which files are part of the task, and which status they have
* Open Task Files:: Opens all task files which are in working mode
* Select Task:: Selects a particular task and set it as Default Task
* Check In Task:: Checks all files and other objects in, and checks in the task (irreversibly)
@end menu

@section Show Default Task
@anchor{Show Default Task}
@cindex default task

(Menu > @ibmrs{} > Show Default Task)@*
(C-c RET d)

Displays the default task, if set, through a message, either in the minibuffer,
or if the customization variable @usemsgbox{} has been set, through a message box.

If the currently selected file is not part of any work area, this function will
not be able to result into a sensible output.

@section Show Task Files
@anchor{Show Task Files}
@cindex task files

(Menu > @ibmrs{} > Show Task Files)@*
(M-x vc-rational-synergy-show-task-files RET)

This will popup the @ibmrs{} Output buffer and show a list of files which are involved 
in the selected default task. It will show the following information for each
individual object:

  The object's name, the object's type, the object's version and instance
  and the current object's status. If the status is ``working'', it will also
  show the actual location of the object in the work area.

Also, the work area itself is displayed in the top of the buffer, so that
it becomes easier to navigate to the proper objects available.

@section Open Task Files
@anchor{Open Task Files}
@cindex task files

(Menu > @ibmrs{} > Open Task Files)@*
(M-x vc-rational-synergy-open-task-files RET)

This will open all the files belonging to the default task in emacs,
unless they are opened already. It uses the same paradigm as `Show Task Files',
so the files opened are the same ``working'' objects.

@section Select Task
@anchor{Select Task}
@cindex select task

(Menu > @ibmrs{} > Select Task)@*
(C-c RET s)

Shows the minibuffer and requests a task to be selected. The task is to
be selected using it's identifier, and if in need, can be interrogated
using the M-h combination. Completion can be accomplished using the TAB key.

@section Check In Task
@anchor {Check In Task}
@cindex checkin

(Menu > @ibmrs{} > Check In Task)@*
(C-c RET t)

Attempts to check in a task, by checking in all non-checked in objects
belonging to the task, further checks in the task. Before commencing
actual check in, checks if all buffers associated to a particular
task's file, are in a non-modified state, and requests a comment before
continuing check in.

If the customization variable @code{vc-rational-synergy-disallow-empty-comment}
is set, a comment must be given, otherwise, the operation will be aborted.

@node Buffer operations, File operations, Task Management, Functionality

(M-x vc-rational-synergy-current-project RET)

@node File operations, Directory operations, Buffer operations, Functionality
@chapter File
@cindex file

There are several file operations available, such as checking in files,
checking out files and registering files.

@menu
* File Checkout:: Checks out a file
* File Undo Checkout:: Undoes the checking out of a file
* File Checkin:: Checks a (modified) file in
* File Register:: Registers a file (adds a file) to the task
@end menu


@section Checkout
@anchor{File Checkout}
@cindex checkout file

(Menu > @ibmrs{} > File > Checkout)@*
(C-c RET o)

This item is only able to complete, when a file is visited using
a buffer within a particular workarea, and a default task is selected.

Checks out the current file from @ibmrs{} into ``working'' state.

@section Undo Checkout
@anchor{File Undo Checkout}
@cindex undo checkout file

(Menu > @ibmrs{} > File > Undo Checkout)@*
(C-c RET u)

Brings the file back into the state before checkout, 
deleting the checked out version from @ibmrs{}. This means that
all modifications currently made, are discarded.

This operations allways requests the user to proceed, even if
the buffer is in a saved state, as data can be permanently lost.

@section Checkin
@anchor {File Checkin}
@cindex checkin file

(Menu > @ibmrs{} > File Checkin)@*
(C-c RET i) 

This item is only able to complete, when a file is visited using
a buffer within a particular workarea, and a default task is selected.

If the buffer is in a saved state, this operation will ask the user
whether or not the buffer should be saved. If it is not so, the
operation will be aborted.

Before checking in, asks the user to enter a comment. If the customization
variable @code{vc-rational-synergy-disallow-empty-comment}
is set, a comment must be given, otherwise, the operation will be aborted.

If all above prerequisites are met, the file is checked in and the
buffer is updated to reflect these changes.

@node Modeline, , Directory operations, Functionality
@chapter Modeline
@cindex modeline

(Menu > @ibmrs{} > Update Modeline)@*
(M-x vc-rational-synergy-update-modeline RET)

It is possible to update the modeline of a buffer. This is especially necessary
if direct operations are performed using the CCM command from within a shell in
Emacs.

The modeline will be updated by appending a suffix to the buffer's name, if the
buffer is visiting a file within a work area. It will show the status of the
file and the version of the file.

This chapter describes how to customize @ibmrs{} mode to suit your wishes and needs.
Emacs customization variables are used.
These are divided in 2 groups of custom-variables govering the mode:
@code{vc-cmsyn-user (User Options)} and @code{vc-cmsyn-admin (Admin Options)}.
The 1st group deals with personal preferences, the 2nd with the way the mode works.

@menu
* User Options::         User Options
* Admin Options::        Administration Options
@end menu

The options should *not* be set with setq but by using the customisation system of emacs.
Call up customization buffers by using M-x customize-variable / customize-group and use the 
set- and save- buttons.
You may also want to take a look in the Options menu under Customize Emacs.
Alternatively edit the custom-set-variables section of your personal init file by hand and set
the options there.
